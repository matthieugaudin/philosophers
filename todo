- bug :
    When it's even, more philo there is more likely a philo will die at die_time + eat_time 
    It occurs when a philo think 3 times think_times, and this occures when they do not
    work in pairs one begins after 2 eat_time cycle
    When it's odd it's always the case


- change the formula to wait odd ?
- wait all philos ?
